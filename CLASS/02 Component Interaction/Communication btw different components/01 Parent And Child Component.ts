We will focus on how parent and child component interacts using : -
Input() decorator : - Parent pass data to child component via input() decorator (react props)
Getters And Setters : - How we can intercept the changes in the input property values with getters and setters
ngOnChanges lifecycle hooks
Template ref Variables
ViewChild()
Emitting event : - A child raise an events to parent component (Just like in react where we can bind a click event to be handled by a method present inside the parent component)
Services : - Not specific to Parent and child but we will see how we can make use of services for component interaction.
